Write 3 methods:
tier 1: return whether there are duplicates in a list of integers (O(n))
tier 2: return whether there are duplicates within k distance away from each other in a list (if they are more than k indices away, they don't count as duplicates) (O(n) still)
tier 3: return whether there are duplicates within k distance of each other, where 2 numbers are duplicates if they are within a tolerance "l" (lower case L) of each other (O(n) optimal, O(n*k) ok)
